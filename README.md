# Unsupervised Model Selection for Object Detection
Implementation of Flatness Index Score (FIS) by Yu et al (2024) found at https://github.com/HenryYu23/DAS.  The metric has been updated to save a checkpoint with the best FIS during training.  Implemented with the ALDI framework by Kay et al (2025) for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for object detection 

Code to follow.
